# ML_Predictive_Model.ipynb_Task-4

This project demonstrates a simple Machine Learning predictive model using a small dataset of study hours vs student scores. It includes data preparation, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a basic ML model that predicts a student's score based on the number of hours they study. This project helps in understanding how to:
- Load and clean data
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Train a Linear Regression model
- Evaluate model accuracy
- Make predictions on new data

## 📁 Files Included
- **ML_Predictive_Model.ipynb_Task-4** — Main Jupyter Notebook with full code and explanations  
- **dataset.csv** — Small dataset containing Hours vs Scores  
- **README.md** — Project description file

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset includes two columns:
- `Hours` — Number of study hours
- `Scores` — Expected marks scored

Example data:
Hours,Scores
1.5,20
2.5,25
3.0,30
...
